### Email Prompt for HP Printers

[CUSTOMER NAME HERE],

I noticed that you have a wireless HP printer on your network. The problem with these printers is that they broadcast their own wifi network, which causes interference. The purpose of this feature is so that people may connect to it to print if they do not have a router. Since you do have a router, this feature can be turned off.

In order to do this, look for a symbol that appears to be an antenna with wireless signals around it. (An example of this is the button in the top right in this picture: https://crbechervaise.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/hp_color_laserjet_pro_m477_printer_touchscreen2.jpg)

Then open wifi direct (or wirelesss direct, HP direct, etc.) and turn it off.

After this is complete, there will no longer be any wireless interference coming from this printer.

## [PS4]
